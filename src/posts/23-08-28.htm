<h2>3D renderer!</h2>

<p>I've started sketching out an ASCII 3D renderer program!</p>

<p>We might not end up using 3D for this project but it's here anyway &#10024;</p>

<p>You give it camera position as (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) [&psi;, &theta;, &phi;] and a labeled point's (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>), as well as the angle in degrees of the FOV, and it <small>theoretically</small> renders every point visible in that area.</p>

<p>There's a chance it's rendering points behind the camera right now, I haven't properly tested, but it kind of works!</p>

<p>Also thinking of ways to make the three components (game, engine, renderer) be modular that aren't too inconvenient. Saving / reading from a file seems like it might be best? Don't know yet.</p>
