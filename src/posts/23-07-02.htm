<h2>the plan</h2>

<p>Hello what are we thinking</p>

<p>On the docket:</p>
<ul>
	<li>pick a language to write the engine in</li>
	<li>make a sketch of the renderer (wireframes) for testing</li>
	<li>write tests for the whole system?</li>
	<li>make working titles for both game and engine/renderer</li>
	<li>set up some collaboration environment that actually works?</li>
	<li>maybe a bit of a schedule?? like just set a goal for some time period and stuff?</li>
</ul>

<p>Today:</p>
<ul>
	<li>more brainstorming for the game story stuff</li>
	<li>looked back at some flipping physics videos and sketched out plaintext of how engine could work (just the 'get postitions' function)</li>
</ul>
