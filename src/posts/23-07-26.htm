<h2>very bad gravity!</h2>

<ul>
	<li>sketched out the beginnings of some physics calculations (gravity, spot to sum forces) in rust engine; gives stdout to renderer</li>
	<li>started making a standard format for engine -&gt; renderer calls</li>
	<li>made a very simple bash script to print a character at coordinates recieved through stdin.</li>
	<li>devlog: added <a href="rss.xml">rss feed</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't figure out how to set a value in one scope and have it persist outside that scope?? idk i still need to learn a lot of things about rust but we shall get there...</p>
