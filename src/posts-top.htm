	<p>This is the devlog for the Cat Engine (not really named yet), and also the Cat Game (also untitled), and also all the other pieces that go along with it.</p>

	<p>By <a href="https://john.umbriac.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">John</a> and <a href="https://tivub.xyz/" rel="external" target="_blank">Tobin</a>.</p>

	<p><small>(I doubt anyone's ever really gonna look at this but I just thought it might be fun to keep a log)<br>(Also this could be a nice way to communicate about the happenings? Like notes on what the aim of a new branch is kind of thing idk yes mhm)</small></p>
