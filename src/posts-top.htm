	<summary><b>about</b></summary>

	<p>This is the devlog for our (untitled) game engine and the cat game (also untitled, it's a game about cats and lasers but they're in the catacombs beneath <a href="https://wiki.tivub.xyz/site/toad-hill.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Toad Hill</a>), and also all the other pieces that go along with it. (put a better lil synopsis here)</p>

	<p>By <a href="https://tivub.xyz/" rel="external" target="_blank">Tobin</a> and <a href="https://john.umbriac.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">John</a>.</p>

	<p><small>(I doubt anyone's really gonna look at this but I just thought it might be fun to keep a log)<br>(Also this could be a nice way to communicate about the happenings? Like notes on what the aim of a new branch is kind of thing idk yes mhm) (but also i might start an email chain that actually sounds much more convenient)</small></p>
